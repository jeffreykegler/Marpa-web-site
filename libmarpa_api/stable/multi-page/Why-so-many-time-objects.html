<h3 class="section">28.2 Why so many time objects?</h3>

<p>Marpa is an aggressively multi-pass algorithm.
Marpa achieves its efficiency,
not in spite of making multiple
passes over the data, but because of it.
Marpa regularly substitutes
two fast O(<var>n</var>) passes for a single
O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>) pass.
Marpa&rsquo;s proliferation of time objects is in
keeping with its multi-pass approach.
</p>
<p>Bocage objects come at no cost,
even for unambiguous parses,
because the same pass that creates the bocage
also deals with other issues that are of major
significance for unambiguous parses.
It is the post-processing of the bocage pass
that enables Marpa to do both left-
and right-recursion in linear time.
</p>
<p>Of the various objects, the best
case for elimination is of the
ordering object.
In many cases, the ordering is trivial.
Either the parse is unambiguous, or the
application does not care about the order in
which parse trees are returned.
But while it would be easy to add an option
to bypass creation of an ordering object,
there is little to be gained from it.
When the ordering is trivial,
its overhead is very small &mdash;
essentially a handful of subroutine calls.
Many orderings accomplish nothing,
but these cost next to nothing.
</p>
<p>Tree objects come at minimal cost to unambiguous grammars,
because the same pass that allows iteration through multiple
parse trees does the tree traversal.
This eliminates much of the work that otherwise would
need to be done in
the valuation time object.
In the current implementation, the valuation time object
needs only to step through a sequence already determined
by the tree iterator.
