<h2 class="chapter">11 Sequence rules</h2>

<p>Traditionally, grammars only allow BNF rules.
Libmarpa allows sequence rules, which express sequences
by allowing
a single RHS symbol to be repeated.
</p>
<p>A sequence rule consists of a LHS and a RHS symbol.
Additionally, the application must indicate the minimum number
of repetitions.
The minimum count must be 0 or 1.
</p>
<p>Optionally, a separator symbol may be specified.
For example, a comma-separated sequence of numbers
</p><pre class="verbatim">     1,42,7192,711,
</pre><p>may be recognized
by specifying the rule <tt>Seq ::= num</tt> and
the separator <tt>comma ::= ','</tt>.
By default, an optional final separator,
as shown in the example above,
is recognized,
but &ldquo;proper separation&rdquo; may also be specified.
In proper separation separators must,
in fact,
come between (&ldquo;separate&rdquo;) items of the sequence.
A final separator is not a separator in the strict sense,
and therefore is not recognized when proper separation is in effect.
For more on specifying sequence rules,
see <a href="Sequence-methods.html#marpa_005fg_005fsequence_005fnew">marpa_g_sequence_new</a>.
</p>
<p>Sequence rules are &ldquo;sugar&rdquo; &mdash;
their presence in the Libmarpa interface does not extend its power.
Every Libmarpa grammar that can be written using sequence rules
can be rewritten as a grammar without sequence rules.
</p>
<p>The RHS symbol and the separator, if there is one,
must not be nullable.
This is because it is not completely clear what
an application intends
when it asks for a sequence of items,
some of which are nullable &mdash;
the most natural interpretation of this usually results in a highly
ambiguous grammar.
</p>
<p>Libmarpa allows highly ambiquous grammars
and a programmer who wants a grammar
with sequences containing nullable items or separators
can write that grammar using BNF rules.
The use of BNF rules
make it clearer that ambiguity is what the programmer
intended, and allows the programmer more flexibility.
</p>
<p>A sequence rule must have a dedicated LHS &mdash;
that is, the LHS of a sequence rule must not be the LHS of
any other rule.
This implies that the LHS of a sequence rule can
never be the LHS of a BNF rule.
</p>
<p>The requirement that the LHS of a sequence rule be
unique is imposed for reasons similar to those
for the
prohibition against RHS and separator nullables.
Often reuse of the LHS of a sequence rule
is simply a mistake.
Even when deliberate,
reuse of the LHS results in a complex grammar,
one which often parses in ways that the programmer
did not intend.
</p>
<p>A programmer who believes they know what they
are doing, and really does want alternative sequences starting
at the same input location, can specify this behavior indirectly.
They can do this by creating two sequence rules with distinct LHS&rsquo;s:
</p><pre class="verbatim">     Seq1 ::= Item1
     Seq2 ::= Item2
</pre><p>and adding a new &ldquo;parent&rdquo; LHS which recognizes the sequences as alternatives.
</p><pre class="verbatim">     SeqChoice ::= Seq1
     SeqChoice ::= Seq2
</pre>
