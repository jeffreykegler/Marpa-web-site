<h3 class="section">5.2 Parsing theory preliminaries</h3>

<p>This document assumes the reader is familiar with parsing
theory.
The following exposition is <strong>not</strong> intended
as either an introduction or a reference.
Instead, it is intended to serve as a guide to the definitions
of parsing terms as used in this document.
</p>
<p>The definitions given are intended to be applicable within Libmarpa,
rather than to reflect general usage.
For example,
Marpa sometimes uses a standard term
with a definition that is different from
the standard definition.
&ldquo;Ambiguous grammar&rdquo; is one example:
See <a href="Ambiguity.html#Ambiguity">Ambiguity</a>.
The term &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; is
another.
See <a href="Terminals.html#Terminals">Terminals</a>.
When a standard term is defined in a non-standard way.
this is explicitly pointed out.
</p>
<p>Readers who want a textbook or tutorial in parsing theory
can look at
Mark Jason Dominus&rsquo;s
excellent chapter on parsing in the Perl context.
See <a href="Dominus-2005.html#Dominus-2005">Dominus 2005</a>.
It is available on-line.
Wikipedia is also an excellent place to start.
See <a href="Wikipedia-BNF-article.html#Wikipedia-BNF-article">Wikipedia BNF article</a>.
</p>
<p>A
<a name="index-grammar"></a>
<em>grammar</em>
is a set of
<a name="index-rule"></a>
<em>rules</em>,
associated with a set of symbols,
one of which is distinguished as the start symbol.
A
<a name="index-symbol-string"></a>
<em>symbol string</em>,
or simply
<a name="index-string"></a>
<em>string</em>
where the meaning is clear,
is an ordered series of symbols.
The
<a name="index-length"></a>
<em>length</em>
of a string is the number of symbols in it.
A symbol string is also called a
<a name="index-sentential-form"></a>
<em>sentential form</em>.
</p>
<p>Some of the symbols are terminals.
For the the moment, we will say that a terminal is a symbol
which may occur in an input to a parse of a grammar.
A careful definition appropriate specifically to Marpa
is below (see <a href="Terminals.html#Terminals">Terminals</a>).
In a parse, an input is either accepted or rejected.
A potential input string,
that is, a sentential form which is made up entirely of terminal symbols,
is called a
<a name="index-sentence"></a>
<em>sentence</em>.
The set of sentences that a grammar accepts is the
<a name="index-language"></a>
<em>language</em>
of the grammar.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that the term language, as it is
used in parsing theory, means something very different
from what it means in ordinary use.
The meaning of the strings is an essential part
of the ordinary idea of what a language is.
In parsing terminology, meaning (or
<a name="index-semantics"></a>
<em>semantics</em>
as it is
called) is a separate issue.
For parsing theory a
language is exactly a set of strings &ndash;
that and nothing more.
</p>
<p>A
<a name="index-recognizer"></a>
<em>recognizer</em>
is a program that determines whether its
<a name="index-input"></a>
<em>input</em>
is in the language of a grammar.
A
<a name="index-parser"></a>
<em>parser</em>
is a program which finds the structure of that input.
</p>
<p>Parsers often use a
<a name="index-lexical-analyzer"></a>
<em>lexical analyzer</em>
to convert
<a name="index-raw-input"></a>
<em>raw input</em>,
usually
<a name="index-input-text"></a>
<em>input text</em>,
into a
<a name="index-token-stream"></a>
<em>token stream</em>,
which is a series of
<a name="index-tokens"></a>
<em>tokens</em>.
Each token represents one or more
<a name="index-symbol"></a>
<em>symbols</em>
of the grammar and has a
<a name="index-value"></a>
<em>value</em>.
(Libmarpa tokens may be ambiguous.
See <a href="Ambiguous-input.html#Ambiguous-input">Ambiguous input</a>.)
A token is also sometimes called a
<a name="index-lexeme"></a>
<em>lexeme</em>.
A lexical analyzer is often called a
<a name="index-lexer"></a>
<em>lexer</em>
or a
<a name="index-scanner"></a>
<em>scanner</em>,
and
<a name="index-lexical-analysis"></a>
<em>lexical analysis</em>
is often called
<a name="index-lexing"></a>
<em>lexing</em>
or
<a name="index-scanning"></a>
<em>scanning</em>.
</p>
<p>The series of symbols represented by the series of tokens
becomes the
<a name="index-symbol-string-input"></a>
<em>symbol string input</em>
seen by the recognizer.
The
<a name="index-symbol-string-input-1"></a>
<em>symbol string input</em>
is more often called the
<a name="index-input-sentence"></a>
<em>input sentence</em>,
or simply the
<a name="index-input-1"></a>
<em>input</em>.
