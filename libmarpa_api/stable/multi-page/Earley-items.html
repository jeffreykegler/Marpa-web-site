<h3 class="section">5.13 Earley items</h3>

<p>We assume knowledge of Earley&rsquo;s algorithm.
This section is intended as a reminder,
and to set out our choices for notation and
terminology.
</p>
<p>A
<a name="index-dotted-rule"></a>
<em>dotted rule</em>
is a duple of rule and
position in the rule.
The position must be an non-negative integer
that is not greater than the length of the rule.
For example,
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display">     [ [ A ::= X Y Z ], 2 ]      (DR1)
</pre></div>
<p>is a dotted rule
whose rule is
<code>[ A ::= X Y Z ]</code> and whose position is 2.
More often a dotted rule is written
with the position marked in the RHS of the rule.
Here we use &ldquo;&bull;&rdquo; as our marker, so that
in <code>(DR1)</code> the &ldquo;&bull;&rdquo; would come after
the 2nd symbol on the RHS,
and <code>(DR1)</code> would be written
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display">     [ A ::= X Y &bull; Z ].
</pre></div>
<p>Traditionally the marker is a raised dot,
and this is where the term &ldquo;dotted rule&rdquo;
comes from.
The position of the dotted rule is almost always
called the
<a name="index-dot-position"></a>
<em>dot position</em>.
</p>
<p>An
<a name="index-Earley-item"></a>
<em>Earley item</em>
is a triple of dotted rule, origin
and current parse location.<a name="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>
The Earley item makes a statement about the progress
of a parse.
The
<a name="index-origin-_0028in-an-Earley-item_0029"></a>
<em>origin</em>
is the parse location where recognition of the
dotted rule begins.
The
<a name="index-current-location-_0028in-an-Earley-item_0029"></a>
<em>current location</em>
is the parse location which recognition of the dotted rule
has reached.
Symbols before the dot position of the dotted rule have been
recognized,
and symbols after the dot position of the dotted rule have yet
to be recognized.
</p>
<p>For example,
in the Earley item
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display">     [ [ A ::= X Y &bull; Z ], 7, 42],
</pre></div>
<p>the dotted rule <code>[ A ::= X Y &bull; Z ]</code> was recognized
as far as the dot position, starting at parse location 7
and ending at parse location 42.
More precisely,
</p><ul>
<li> the rule <code>[ A ::= X Y Z ]</code> was expected
    beginning at parse location 7;
</li><li> the string of symbols &ldquo;<code>X Y</code>&rdquo; has been recognized
    starting at parse location 7,
    which implies that the symbol <code>X</code> has been recognized
    starting at parse location 7;
</li><li> the string of symbols &ldquo;<code>X Y</code>&rdquo; has been recognized
    ending at parse location 42,
    which implies that the symbol <code>Y</code> has been recognized
    ending at parse location 42; and
</li><li> the symbol <code>Z</code> has yet to recognized,
    but is expected starting at parse location 42.
</li></ul>

<p>The Earley set at location <code>j</code>
is the set of Earley items whose current location is <code>j</code>.
For example, the Earley item
<code>[ [ A ::= X Y &bull; Z ], 7, 42]</code>
is in the Earley set at location 42.
</p>
<p>We say that a dotted rule is
<a name="index-completed-dotted-rule"></a>
<em>completed</em>
iff its dot position is after the last symbol.
We say that an Earley item is
<a name="index-completed-Earley-item"></a>
<em>completed</em>
iff its dotted rule is completed.
For example, the Earley item
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display">     [ [ A ::= X Y Z &bull; ], 7, 50],
</pre></div>
<p>is completed.
A completed dotted rule is also called a
<a name="index-completion-_0028dotted-rule_0029"></a>
<em>completion</em>.
Similarly, a completed Earley item is also called a
<a name="index-completion-_0028Earley-item_0029"></a>
<em>completion</em>.
</p>
<p>We say that a dotted rule is
<a name="index-predicted-dotted-rule"></a>
<em>predicted</em>
iff its dot position is before the first symbol.
We say that an Earley item is
<a name="index-predicted-Earley-item"></a>
<em>predicted</em>
iff its dotted rule is predicted.
For example, the Earley item
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display">     [ [ A ::= &bull; X Y Z ], 7, 7],
</pre></div>
<p>is predicted.
A predicted dotted rule is also called a
<a name="index-prediction-_0028dotted-rule_0029"></a>
<em>prediction</em>.
Similarly, a predicted Earley item is also called a
<a name="index-prediction-_0028Earley-item_0029"></a>
<em>prediction</em>.
</p>
<p>The
<a name="index-postdot-symbol-_0028of-a-dotted-rule_0029"></a>
<em>postdot symbol</em>
of a dotted rule is the RHS symbol after the
dot position.
For example, in the dotted rule,
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display">     [ A ::= X Y &bull; Z ]
</pre></div>
<p>the postdot symbol is <code>Z</code>.
If the dotted rule is a completion,
its postdot symbol is not defined.
</p>
<p>The
<a name="index-postdot-symbol-_0028of-an-Earley-item_0029"></a>
<em>postdot symbol</em>
of an Earley item
is the postdot symbol of its dotted rule.
The postdot symbol of an Earley item is an
<a name="index-expected-symbol"></a>
<em>expected symbol</em>
at its current location.
For example,
the Earley item
</p><div class="display">
<pre class="display">     [ [ A ::= X Y &bull; Z ], 7, 42],
</pre></div>
<p>indicates that the symbol <code>Z</code>
is expected at location 42.
</p>
<p>Let <code>sym</code> be a symbol,
and let <code>j</code> be a parse location.
Unless <code>sym</code> is expected at <code>j</code>,
that is, unless <code>sym</code> is a postdot symbol of some Earley
item in the Earley set at <code>j</code>,
<code>sym</code> will be rejected by the
<code>marpa_r_alternative()</code> method
at current location <code>j</code>.

<p>Those interested in details of notation
    may notice that we
    include current location in the Earley item
    tuple, contrary to the tradition.
    We develop our notation more formally,
    and explain our reasons
    for the deviation from tradition,
    on pages 5-7 of
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04093v1">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04093v1</a>.
