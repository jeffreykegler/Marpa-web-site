<h3 class="section">25.1 Overview</h3>

<p>This chapter discusses Libmarpa&rsquo;s events.
It contains descriptions of both grammar and recognizer methods.
</p>
<p>A method is
<a name="index-event_002dtriggering-_0028method_0029"></a>
<em>event-triggering</em>
iff it can add event instances to the
<a name="index-event-queue"></a>
<em>event queue</em>.
The event-triggering methods are
<code>marpa_g_precompute()</code>,
<code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>,
and
<code>marpa_r_start_input()</code>.
The event-triggering methods always clear all previous events
so that, on return from an event-triggering method,
the only events in the event queue will be
the events triggered by that method.
</p>
<p>Every event instance has a type, and a subtype.
The type of an event instance is its
<em>code</em>,
such as <code>MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_COMPLETED</code>.
Event codes are listed in a later section.
See <a href="Event-codes.html#Event-codes">Event codes</a>.
Subtypes will be described shortly.
</p>
<p>Event types are either
<a name="index-implicit-event-type"></a>
<em>implicit</em>
or
<a name="index-explicit-event-type"></a>
<em>explicit</em>.
Intuitively, implicit event types are
available to the application without any action
by the user;
and explicit event types are not available
unless the user calls certains methods which are
available for that purpose.
</p>
<p>Event are also either
<a name="index-global-event"></a>
<a name="index-event_002c-global"></a>
<em>global</em>
or
<a name="index-per_002dsymbol-event"></a>
<a name="index-event_002c-per_002dsymbol"></a>
<em>per-symbol</em>.
In any event-triggering method,
at most one event instance can trigger for each subtype.
If an event type is
<a name="index-global-event-1"></a>
<em>global</em>,
it has only one subtype,
and only one event instance of that type
may trigger in a method call.
If an event is
<a name="index-per_002dsymbol-event-1"></a>
<em>per-symbol</em>,
it has one subtype for each symbol in grammar.
Many instances of a per-symbol event may trigger
in a method call,
up to the number of symbols in the grammar.
</p>
<p>All global event types are implicit.
All explicit event types are per-symbol.
The reason for event types to be explicit
is to avoid the overhead of unused events,
and for per-symbol event types there might
be many such events.
</p>
<p>For an event instance to trigger,
its event subtype must first be
<a name="index-declared-event-subtype"></a>
<em>declared</em>.
Subtypes of implicit events are always
declared &mdash;
declaring them requires no action on the part
of the user.
Subtypes
of explicit event types must be declared by the user,
using a method call provided
for that purpose.
Once declared, an event subtype remains declared:
there is no way to remove or undo the declaration
of an event subtype.
Details of event declaration are provided,
by event code,
in the section on event codes.
See <a href="Event-codes.html#Event-codes">Event codes</a>.
</p>
<p>A declared event subtype can be activated.
An event instance will not trigger,
unless its event subtype is
<a name="index-activated-event-subtype"></a>
<em>activated</em>.
Subtypes of implicit event are always
activated &mdash;
activating them requires no action on the part
of the user.
Subtypes of explicit event types must be activated by the user,
using a method call provided
for that purpose.
Implicitly activated event subtypes cannot be deactivated.
Some explicitly activated event subtypes can be
deactivated, using a method call available for that purpose.
Details of event activation are provided,
by event code,
in the section on event codes.
See <a href="Event-codes.html#Event-codes">Event codes</a>.
</p>
<p>When a recognizer is created,
the event subtypes of a recognizer inherit their declared
and activated status from the events of the base
grammar.
See <a href="Creating-a-new-recognizer.html#marpa_005fr_005fnew">marpa_r_new()</a>.
</p>
<p>A Libmarpa method or macro is
<a name="index-event_002dsafe-_0028method_0029"></a>
<em>event-safe</em>
iff it does not change the events queue.
All Libmarpa accessors are event-safe.
</p>
<p>Regardless of the event-safety of the method calls
between event triggering and event access,
it is good practice to access event instances
as soon as reasonable after the method that triggered them.
Note that the event queue is kept in the base grammar,
so that multiple recognizers using the same base grammar
can overwrite each other&rsquo;s events.
</p>
<p>To find out how many events are in the event queue,
use the
<code>marpa_g_event_count()</code>
method.
See <a href="Basic-event-accessors.html#marpa_005fg_005fevent_005fcount">marpa_g_event_count()</a>.
</p>
<p>To access specific events,
use the
<code>marpa_g_event()</code>
(see <a href="Basic-event-accessors.html#marpa_005fg_005fevent">marpa_g_event()</a>)
and
<code>marpa_g_event_value()</code>
(see <a href="Basic-event-accessors.html#marpa_005fg_005fevent_005fvalue">marpa_g_event_value()</a>)
methods.
