<h3 class="section">6.3 Reference counting</h3>

<p>Every object in a &ldquo;time&rdquo; class
has its own, distinct, lifetime,
which is controlled by the object&rsquo;s reference count.
Reference counting follows the usual practice.
Contexts that take a share of the
&ldquo;ownership&rdquo; of an object
increase the reference count by 1.
When a context relinquishes its share of
the ownership of an object, it decreases the reference
count by 1.
</p>
<p>Each class of time object has a &ldquo;ref&rdquo; and an &ldquo;unref&rdquo;
method, to be used by those contexts that need to
explicitly increment and decrement the reference count.
For example, the &ldquo;ref&rdquo; method for the grammar class is
<code>marpa_g_ref()</code>
and the &ldquo;unref&rdquo; method for the grammar class is
<code>marpa_g_unref()</code>.
</p>
<p>Time objects do not have explicit destructors.
When the reference count of a time object reaches
0, that time object is destroyed.
</p>
<p>Much of the necessary reference counting
is performed automatically.
The context calling the constructor of a time object
does not need to explicitly increase the reference
count, because
Libmarpa time objects are
always created with a reference count of 1.
</p>
<p>Child objects &ldquo;own&rdquo; their parents,
and when a child object is successfully created,
the reference count of its parent object is
automatically incremented to reflect this.
When a child object is destroyed, it
automatically decrements the reference count of its parent.
</p>
<p>In a typical application, a calling context needs only
to remember
to &ldquo;unref&rdquo; each time object that it creates,
once it is finished with that time object.
All other reference decrements and increments are taken
care of automatically.
The typical application never needs to explicitly
call one of the &ldquo;ref&rdquo; methods.
</p>
<p>More complex applications may find it convenient
to have one or more contexts share ownership of objects
created in another context.
These more complex situations
are the only cases in which the &ldquo;ref&rdquo; methods
will be needed.
