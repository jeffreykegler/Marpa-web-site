<h4 class="subsection">31.1.2 Motivation of LHS terminals</h4>

<p>Recall that a terminal symbol is a symbol that
may appear in the input.
Traditionally,
all LHS symbols, as well as
the start symbol, must be non-terminals.
By default, this is Marpa&rsquo;s behavior.
</p>
<p>In a departure from tradition,
Marpa had a feature that allowed the user to eliminate the distinction
between terminals and non-terminals.
This feature is now deprecated.
</p>
<p>When LHS terminals are in use,
a terminal
can appear on the LHS of one or more rules,
and can be be the start symbol.
Note however,
that terminals can never be zero length.
</p>
<p>The basis of the LHS terminals feature
was that,
while sharp division between terminals
and non-terminals was
a useful simplification for proving theorems,
it was not essential in practice.
In the UNIX &ldquo;toolkit&rdquo; tradition,
the practice has been to include even awkward,
dangerous tools with no known use, in the toolkit.
The philosophy was that empowering the user who
discovers new techniques is more important
than playing nanny to the toolkit&rsquo;s users.
</p>
<p>LHS symbols
could be used to bypass,
or &ldquo;short circuit&rdquo;, the rules on whose LHS they occur.
Short circuiting rules, it was thought,
might prove helpful in debugging, or have other applications.
</p>
<p>But, a decade after the release of Libmarpa,
no uses for LHS symbols have
emerged.
And they do introduce many new corner cases
into the code and complicate the API documentation.
