<h3 class="section">14.1 Libmarpa&rsquo;s approach to failure</h3>

<p>Libmarpa is a C language library,
and inherits the traditional C language approach to
avoiding and handling application programming errors.
The burden this C tradition
puts on the application programmer
might strike readers unfamiliar with that tradition
as appallingly large.
</p>
<p>But in the early 1970&rsquo;s, when the C language first stabilized,
the alternative,
and the consensus choice for its target applications,
was assembly language.
In that context, C was radical in its willingness to
incur a price in efficiency in order to protect programmers
from themselves.
C was considered to take a excessively &ldquo;hand holding&rdquo;
approach which very much flew in the face of consensus.
</p>
<p>The decades have made a large difference in the trade-offs,
and the consensus about the degree to which even a
low-level language should protect the user has changed.
It seems inevitable that C will be replaced as the low-level
language of choice, by a language that places
fewer burdens on the programmer,
and more on the machine.
The question seems to be not whether C will be dethroned
as the &ldquo;go to&rdquo; language for low-level progamming,
but when, and by which alternative.
</p>
<p>Modern hardware makes many simple checks essentially cost-free,
and Libmarpa&rsquo;s efforts to protect the application programmer go well
beyond what
would have been considered best practice in the past.
But it remains a C language library.
The Libmarpa application programmer must be prepared to exercise
the high degree of carefulness traditionally required for C language programming.
Libmarpa
places the burden of avoiding irrecoverable failures,
and of handling recoverable failures,
largely on the application programmer.
