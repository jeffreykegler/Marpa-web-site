<p>These methods, respectively, set

When <var>rule_id</var> is created, its rank
initialized to the default rank of the grammar.
</p>
<p>Initially, the default rank of the grammar is 0.
Methods to reset the grammar&rsquo;s default rank
are currently in the experimental stage.
</p>
<p>Return value: On success, returns
the rank <strong>after</strong>
the call,
and sets the error code to
<code>MARPA_ERR_NONE</code>.
On failure, returns -2,
and sets the error code to an appropriate
value, which will never be
<code>MARPA_ERR_NONE</code>.
Note that when the rank is -2,
the error code is the only way to distinguish
success from failure.
The error code can be determined by using the
<code>marpa_g_error()</code> call.

<p>These methods, respectively, set
and query the &ldquo;null ranks high&rdquo; setting of the rule <var>rule_id</var>.
The &ldquo;null ranks high&rdquo; setting is either 0 or 1.
When <var>rule_id</var> is created, its &ldquo;null ranks high&rdquo;
setting is initialized to 0.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;null ranks high&rdquo; setting affects the ranking of rules
with properly nullable symbols on their right hand side.
If a rule has properly nullable symbols on its RHS,
each instance in which it appears in a parse will have a pattern
of nulled and non-nulled symbols.
Such a pattern is called a &ldquo;null variant&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>If the &ldquo;null ranks high&rdquo; setting is 0 (the default),
nulled symbols rank low.
If the &ldquo;null ranks high&rdquo; setting is 1,
nulled symbols rank high.
Ranking of a null variants is done from left-to-right.
</p>
<p>The <code>marpa_g_rule_null_high_set()</code> method will
return failure
after the grammar has been precomputed.
If there is no other cause of failure,
the <code>marpa_g_rule_null_high()</code> method succeeds
on both precomputed and unprecomputed grammars.
</p>
<p>Success return value:
The value
of the &ldquo;null ranks high&rdquo; flag <strong>after</strong>
the call.

<p>Failure return value:
If rule_id is well-formed, but there is no such rule, -1.
On all other failures, -2.

<p>Libmarpa can be set up to generate an 
<code>MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_COMPLETED</code>
event whenever the symbol is completed.
A symbol is said to be <strong>completed</strong>
when a non-nulling rule with
that symbol on its LHS is completed.
</p>
<p>For completion events to occur, the symbol must be marked
as a completion event symbol.
The <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_completion_event_set()</code> function
marks symbol <var>sym_id</var> as a completion event symbol
if <var>value</var> is 1,
and unmarks it
it as a completion event symbol if <var>value</var> is 0.
The <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_completion_event()</code> method
returns the current value of the completion event marking
for symbol <var>sym_id</var>.
</p>
<p>Marking a completion event sets its activation status to on.
Unmarking a completion event sets its activation status to off.
The completion event marking cannot be changed once
the grammar is precomputed.
</p>
<p>If a completion event is marked,
its activation status can be changed using the
<code>marpa_g_completion_symbol_activate()</code> method.
Note that, if a symbol is marked as a completion event symbol
in the recognizer,
its completion event can be deactivated
and reactivated in the recognizer.
</p>
<p>Nulled rules and symbols will never cause completion events.
Nullable symbols
may be marked as completion event symbols,
but this will have an effect only when the symbol
is not nulled.
Nulling symbols
may be marked as completion event symbols,
but no completion events will ever be generated
for a nulling symbol.
Note that this implies at no completion event will
ever be generated at earleme 0,
the start of parsing.
</p>
<p>Success: On success, 1 if symbol <var>sym_id</var>
is a completion event symbol after the
call, 0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>Failures:
If <var>sym_id</var> is well-formed, but there is no
such symbol, -1.

<dd>
<p>Libmarpa can set up to generate
an <code>MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_NULLED</code>
event whenever the symbol is nulled.
A symbol is said to be <strong>nulled</strong>
when a zero length instance of that symbol
is recognized.
</p>
<p>For nulled events to occur, the symbol must be marked
as a nulled event symbol.
The <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_nulled_event_set()</code> function
marks symbol <var>sym_id</var> as a nulled event symbol
if <var>value</var> is 1,
and unmarks it
it as a nulled event symbol if <var>value</var> is 0.
The <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_nulled_event()</code> method
returns the current value of the nulled event marking
for symbol <var>sym_id</var>.
</p>
<p>Marking a nulled event sets its activation status to on.
Unmarking a nulled event sets its activation status to off.
The nulled event marking cannot be changed once
the grammar is precomputed.
</p>
<p>If a nulled event is marked,
its activation status can be changed using the
<code>marpa_g_nulled_symbol_activate()</code> method.
Note that, if a symbol is marked as a nulled event symbol
in the recognizer,
its nulled event can be deactivated
and reactivated in the recognizer.
</p>
<p>As a reminder, a symbol instance is a symbol
at a specific location in the input,
and with a specific length.
Also, whenever a nulled symbol instance is
recognized at a location, it is acceptable
at that location,
and vice versa.
</p>
<p>When a symbol instance is recognized at a location,
it will generate a nulled event or a prediction event,
but never both.
A symbol instance of zero length,
when recognized at a location,
generates a nulled event at that location,
and does not generate a completion event.
A symbol instance of non-zero length,
when acceptable at a location,
generates a completion event at that location,
and does not generate a nulled event.
</p>
<p>When a symbol instance is acceptable at a location,
it will generate a nulled event or a prediction event,
but never both.
A symbol instance of zero length,
when acceptable at a location,
generates a nulled event at that location,
and does not generate a prediction event.
A symbol instance of non-zero length,
when acceptable at a location,
generates a prediction event at that location,
and does not generate a nulled event.
</p>
<p>While it is not possible for
a <strong>symbol instance</strong>
to generate both a nulled event and
a completion event at a location,
it is quite possible that
a <strong>symbol</strong> might generate
both kinds of event at that location.
This is because multiple instances
of the same symbol may be recognized at
a given location,
and these instances will have
different lengths.
If one instance is recognized at a given location
as zero length and
a second, non-zero-length,
instance is recognized at the same location,
the first will generate only nulled events,
while the second will generate only completion events.
For similar reasons,
while a <strong>symbol instance</strong> will never
generate both a null event and a prediction
event at a location,
multiple instances of the same symbol
may do so.
</p>
<p>Zero length derivations can be ambiguous.
When a zero length symbol is recognized,
all of its zero-length derivations are also considered to be
recognized.
</p>
<p>The <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_nulled_event_set()</code> method will
mark a symbol as a nulled event symbol,
even if the symbol is non-nullable.
This is convenient, for example,
for automatically generated grammars.
Applications which wish to treat
it as a failure if there is an
attempt to
mark a non-nullable symbol
as a nulled event symbol,
can check for this case using
the <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_nullable()</code>
method.
</p>
<p>Success: On success, 1 if symbol <var>sym_id</var>
is a nulled event symbol after the
call, 0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>Failures:
If <var>sym_id</var> is well-formed, but there is no
such symbol, -1.
If the grammar <var>g</var> is precomputed;
or on other failure, -2.

<p>Libmarpa can be set up
to generate a
<code>MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_PREDICTED</code>
event when a non-nulled symbol is predicted.
A non-nulled symbol is said to be <strong>predicted</strong>
when a instance of it
is acceptable at the current
earleme according to the grammar.
Nulled symbols do not generate predictions.
</p>
<p>For predicted events to occur, the symbol must be marked
as a predicted event symbol.
The <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_predicted_event_set()</code> function
marks symbol <var>sym_id</var> as a predicted event symbol

The <code>marpa_g_symbol_is_predicted_event()</code> method
